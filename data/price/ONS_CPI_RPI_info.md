Thank you for contacting us.

 

The fish representative items we include in our basket of goods and services are as follows:

- Fresh white fish fillets
- Fresh salmon fillets
- Frozen prawns
- Canned tuna
- Frozen fish fingers
- Frozen breaded/battered white fish

 

Monthly average prices, and monthly price indices, for each of the above as measured by the CPI can be found in our [shop price comparison tool](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/shoppingpricescomparisontool/2023-05-03), if you click Download all data under the interactive graphic. The  resulting .xlsx file contains the metadata tab, where you can search by  product name (column I) and find each item’s matching product ID in  column A, for instance Fresh salmon fillets is item 211105. This ID can  be used in the tabs ‘chained’ (to see a chained index with Jan 2018=100) and ‘averageprice’ (to see monthly average prices). For these fish  items, it appears that data is available for Jan 2018 to present.

 

Note that there is some subtlety around how these CPI average prices in  particular are calculated, see the shop price comparison tool article  linked above for more info, under the ‘Average prices’ heading.

 

Turning to your specific questions – if by ‘relative RPI (base year)’ you mean a price index such as the [RPI all-items index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/chaw/mm23) (Jan 1987 =100), and so if the question is around what is the  difference between an average price series and a price index series, the two are inter-related. As a generalisation, we collect prices for a  range of products across different shops and regions each month, and for each product in our sample we construct a ‘price relative’ by dividing  it’s price in the current month by it’s price in the base month  (generally January). We then aggregate the resulting price relatives  over regions, shops, items etc. using a mix of unweighted averages  (generally the arithmetic mean for RPI and geometric mean for CPI) and  weighted averages (where we aim to weigh each component according to how much consumer expenditure there is on that component relative to  others), eventually we arrive at the CPI or RPI all-items price  relative. Once aggregation is finished, can chain-link these aggregated  price relatives on to previous years’ values to create a longer-running  series equal to 100 in 2015 (for CPI) or Jan 1987 (for RPI). 

 

As a stage in that process we produce the item-level price indices, so  there will be a CPI and RPI item index for each of the representative  fish items listed above. How we use this to calculate average monthly  prices is described for CPI in the shop price comparison tool article  linked above, and is described for the RPI in section 13.5 of the [Consumer prices indices Technical manual](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/consumerpricesindicestechnicalmanual2019). To simplify, our process is to take the average price for the given  item  in January, then uprate it by movements in the item-level price  index throughout the year up to and including the subsequent January,  before restarting the process. The advantage is that changes in  composition of products within a year should not lead to spurious  movements. The downside is that there will be discontinuities between  January and February’s average prices in a given year.

 

As to the question of if we publish a salmon price index for RPI (Jan  1987=100), I do not believe we do. We do not tend to publish  long-running index series for very low levels of detail (e.g. for  individual representative items). It may be due to historical reasons  that we publish the long-running average series for salmon – we don’t  publish any such series for the other representative items e.g. Tuna, as all long-running time series we publish can be found in [this data file](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindices). As mentioned, there is a CPI average prices and price indices series  going back to Jan 2018 for the fish representative items mentioned  above.

 

A more detailed explanation of how we construct CPI and RPI can be found in the Technical manual linked above.
